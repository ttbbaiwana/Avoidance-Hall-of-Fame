  <h1>AHoF Rating Poll</h1>

  <p>
    For each avoidance, I ask that you only rate the ones you have either
    cleared, played for a very long time, or have reached the final attack.
    Your opinion will be disregarded otherwise.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you feel you are not experienced or knowledgeable enough to know,
    then don't vote. I also ask that you have at least <strong>5 AHoF clears</strong>
    so you have a better understanding of how to compare games at a high level.
  </p>
