    <h1>AHoF Rating Poll</h1>
    <p>
      Welcome to the AHoF Rating Poll! Here you can rate AHoF avoidances based on various difficulty dimensions, and by quality.
      Your answers help to curate the list for others. Note that this does not affect the official difficulty order of the games,
      but it will help players understand the strengths and weaknesses of individual avoidances.
    </p>
    <p>
      Click on <strong>"Info"</strong> and read the <strong>"Category Information"</strong> before rating!
    </p>
    <p>
      For each avoidance, I ask that you only rate the ones you have either
      <strong>cleared, played for a very long time, or have reached the final attack.</strong>
      Your opinion will be disregarded otherwise.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you feel you are not experienced or knowledgeable enough to know,
      then don't vote. I also ask that you have at least <strong>5 AHoF clears</strong>
      so you have a better understanding of how to compare games at a high level.
